🐧 地图匹配流程
===================================

(还在完善中...)

开展一个离线地图匹配项目，我们需要GPS数据与路网数据。这两部分数据的质量也是决定我们匹配效果的关键。对于GPS数据的预处理、路网数据的校核必不可少。


1. 清洗GPS数据
--------------------


1.1. 坐标系核查

1.2. 行程切分
`````````````````````````````````````````````````

1.3. 数据清洗
`````````````````````````````````````````````````


2. 校核路网数据
--------------------


2.1. 认识路网数据
`````````````````````````````````````````````````


2.2 路网文件的常见存储类型
`````````````````````````````````````````````````

geojson、shp、csv、sqlite、TransCAD的dbd文件


2.3. 认识连通性
`````````````````````````````````````````````````


3. 依据GPS数据质量合理选择gotrackit的匹配参数
